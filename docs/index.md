# Cutting-Edge project

*Academic research project conducted between January and March 2023*

## Motivation

Insurers use economic scenarios of the main financial indicators of the state of an economy (i.e. simulated trajectories of interest rates, equity indices, etc.) to calculate a measure of risk (in other words, a quantile on the loss distribution).

Its purpose is to report on the level of risk embedded in the products in the insurer's portfolio.


Trajectories of updated equity indices are simulated using models calibrated on market prices. The joint law of the interest rate / equity index couple therefore has an impact on the quantile finally calculated. It is proposed in this subject to implement simulation schemes of some rate and equity models and to study the joint law of the rate / equity couple by simulation. Sensitivities will be carried out. A study of the impact of the parameters (models, discretization, etc.) on the quantile levels will be carried out.


A generic plan:
1. Interest-rates modelling
2. Equity-index modelling
3. In-depth analysis of simulation results
